# dp-com

What youâ€™re looking at is the (quite messy) code base for the static web app that is my personal website. Have a look at it **[here](https://danielputzer.com)**.  
The whole thing is built on VueJs, bundled with Parcel and hosted on Netlify.

### Installation & Usage

```node
/* After cloning, install all dependencies */
npm install

/* Then run the application locally */
npm run start
```

### Planned Updates

It has been a while since this page has gotten a proper update. While I am still happy with the design overall, the code base is messy and a static page just doesn't cut it anymore. Once I get around to working on this one again I am planning on hooking it up to a headless CMS (probably [Strapi](https://strapi.io)), clean up the Vue code and add some meaningful commentary here and there.

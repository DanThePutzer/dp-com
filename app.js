Messages on Slack, files stored on DropBox, notes shared on Evernote and many ideas and random thoughts written down on whatever piece of paper had been nearest. There had to be a better way. As we were planning on working together on many projects in the future, we thought it would be cool to have a platform to base our work on. So we started working on it. With time the concept grew and we decided to make it public for everyone to use. Weâ€™d learn a lot about taking a large web app from 0 onto the desktops of users and it might help some people out there channel their inner stream of ideas. A win-win.',

  text: "I like to tinker with design and try to create appealing interfaces with great user experience. My main tool used to be Sketch, but as I am preparing to switch back to a Windows machine I've slowly and steadily replaced it with Adobe Xperience Design. Much of my design work is tied directly to personal projects, but I also like to give interfaces I interact with regularly my own personal spin. Check out the redesign of TensorBoard's UI below, hit the link above for more select shots of my design work."

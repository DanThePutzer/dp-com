    text: 'It all started as a personal project, just for us. We found ourselves digging through forests of thoughts spread across many different apps and sloppily written notes. Messages on Slack, files stored on DropBox, notes shared on Evernote and many ideas and random thoughts written down on whatever piece of paper had been nearest. There had to be a better way. As we were planning on working together on many projects in the future, we thought it would be cool to have a platform to base our work on. So we started working on it. With time the concept grew and we decided to make it public for everyone to use. We’d learn a lot about taking a large web app from 0 onto the desktops of users and it might help some people out there channel their inner stream of ideas. A win-win.',

There are a lot of good solutions to this out there already, but we thought our concept wouldn’t be complete without some means of communication. Slack was our main inspiration for this part of the platform, with a few distinct improvements to the concept to make it a little more our own.'

A way to collect material to support ideas and concepts as well as storing files, images, links etc. were a must, but we didn’t want to go with the classic MS Word-style editor, as the text-centered approach seemed inappropriate in a time where other forms of media are just as important. So we gave it a little spin (more on that further down). Additionally, we thought a way to create and assign tasks would be nice to keep people on track and working.'

To be able to capture and further develop our ideas we wanted a way to channel the chaotic storm of thoughts into an organized, and clear structure.'

If you google DropSeed all you get is a Wikipedia article about a plant called Sporobolus). The idea behind the name is simple. We see every idea or thought as a seed that, if dropped into the right environment and taken care of properly, can germinate and grow into something strong and big, like a tree.',

In addition to all the standard functionality of this pretty basic feature, tasks can be claimed by people. By claiming a task, you can show your collaborators that a particular task is currently being worked on by you. Claimed tasks will be shown in a separate box at the very top of the list view.',

    title: 'Notes',
    text: 'There’s hundreds of note-taking apps out there and DropSeed also needed a way to collect and store information in some similar way. We didn’t like the idea of going with the standard MS Word-style editor. The concept, with its text-focused approach, felt a bit outdated, since nowadays notes are much more than just text. People share and collect images, files, links etc. and we wanted to build something that takes all these different media types into account. After tossing some concepts around for a while we decided to go with a grid-like structure for the editor, where you can create different types of blocks (text, media, links etc.) and put them together your way. Check out the example below to get a sense of what we’re talking about.',

    text: 'Each tree has one main thought that defines it and sub thoughts branching out from it to further define and build on that main thought. Thoughts can be directly shared with collaborators in the feed or link to a note with more content regarding the thought. A problem we faced (and still face to some degree) is that trees can get pretty large and hard to overlook once you get going. To help with that we gave a thought the possibility to be a so-called anchor thought. Anchor thoughts are the most important thoughts in a tree. Any thought can be turned into an anchor thought be clicking a button and if things get messy, you can filter for anchor thoughts only to get the most important bits of a tree.',

Threads can be filtered for shared links, media or files to make finding shared content a little easier. It is also integrated with all the other DropSeed features. Notes and individual note blocks, lists, tasks and thoughts can be shared directly to any thread or private chat without leaving their respective window. We also made sure Emojis on board for those of you who like to communicate a little more visually :)',

    "After reading WaitButWhy's blog posts about artificial intelligence (linked below) my mind was completely blown. I always knew technology was immensely powerful and expected it to become even more so in the future, but the picture of the future being painted in those blog posts went beyond everything I conceived possible.",
    "Since then I've dug deeper into the subject, trying to gain a better understanding of the technological, but also the philosophical and ethical aspects of artificial intelligence. I came to believe that this technology is bound to become an incredibly powerful force that will shape our future and change how humans live, even more so than it already does today.",
    "This power can be used to do lots of good things for us, our planet and it's inhabitants and our ambitions as a species. However, if approached wrongly, artificial intelligence is powerful enough to cause devastation on a scale never seen before.",
    "Seeing all this, I decided this was a field I wanted to do some work in and collect more knowlegde about. I spend time on this subject on a daily basis. You can find some of my work, studies and favorite resources below."
